    "# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Terms\n",
    "This problem consists of just a single exercise, worth ten (10) points. This problem is the second of many on the site Project Euler, a set of Number Theory-based computational problems. You might find some of the other problems to be fun challenges - but be warned, they scale up in difficulty quickly as you complete them!\n",

    "\n",
    "Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with `1` and `1`, the list of terms not exceeding `100` is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.\n",
    "        \n",
    "That is, the next term, `55+89=144`, exceeds `100`, so we would stop at `89`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your computational task is to calculate the sum of the **even-valued** terms that are **less than** a given number. In this example, if the given number is `100`, then the sum of even-valued terms would be `2+8+34=44`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 0** (10 points). Write a function, `even_fib_sum(n)`, that takes a specific value, `n`, as input, and returns the sum of the even-valued Fibonacci sequence terms that do not exceed `n`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        even_fib_sum(100) = 44 ( = 2 + 8 + 34)\n",
    "        even_fib_sum(200) = 188 ( = 2 + 8 + 34 + 144)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that we are not interested in the **nth** term in the sequence, but simply the Fibonacci numbers that are strictly less than `n`. "
